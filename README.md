This is a Pokemon Wiki made using React and the PokeAPI.

There is no database for this project and there are many calls, so there are load times.

DEVELOPER NOTES:

- I am aware of the performance issues when searching on Pokedex Page and hope to fix that in the future.
- Not sure how to get around the performace issues that arise when loading all pokemon, which makes it almost impossible to search through all pokemon.
- I will hope to add more sections to this project such as detailed pages for pokemon, abilities, moves, generations, etc.
